# Timoneer

![Timoneer](/resources/logo_transparent.png "Timoneer")

Lightweight Docker Web Client on the browser. (**Still on early development**)

## What's Included

This is an Angular application which runs on the browser. It does not include its own API, hence it can do nothing more than Docker's own API allows to.

You'll need to expose your Docker Daemon's API through HTTP/S for Timoneer to work.
